# IEEE 118-Bus Cyber-Physical Power System (CPPS) Data Streams

This repository contains data related to the IEEE 118-bus Cyber-Physical Power System (CPPS) for evaluating diagnostic methodologies in smart grid research.

## Overview

The IEEE 118-bus CPPS is a widely-used benchmark system in smart grid research that integrates physical components (generators, transformers, loads, transmission lines) with cyber components (protective relays, voltage regulators, controllers). This interaction is crucial for system stability and reliable power delivery. 

The data provided in this repository supports the research findings detailed in the following paper:

## Fault Scenarios

The data collection involves simulating various fault scenarios in the IEEE 118-bus CPPS using PowerFactory. Faults are categorized into:

- **Load-Loss (LL)**
- **Generator Outage (GO)**
- **Generator Ground (GG)**

Each fault type is simulated as follows:

- **LL/GO Faults:** A breaker disconnects the load or generator from the bus for 25 ms.
- **GG Faults:** Three-phase short-circuit faults are simulated between generation units and the ground.

Data is collected for 25 ms at a sampling rate of 10 kHz, resulting in 250 samples per scenario. The simulated fault scenarios include:

- 31 LL faults
- 19 GO faults
- 19 GG faults
- 1 normal operational state

## Data Collection

Six datasets are constructed based on different Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and Fault Resistance (FR) values. Each dataset is detailed in the table below:

| Dataset | SNR (dB) | FR (Î©) | # Samples | # Features |
|---------|----------|--------|-----------|------------|
| data_1ohm_50db      | 50       | 1      | 17,500    | 354        |
| data_1ohm_55db      | 55       | 1      | 17,500    | 354        |
| data_1ohm_60db      | 60       | 1      | 17,500    | 354        |
| data_10ohm_50db      | 50       | 10     | 17,500    | 354        |
| data_10ohm_55db      | 55       | 10     | 17,500    | 354        |
| data_10ohm_60db      | 60       | 10     | 17,500    | 354        |

## Collected Features

The features collected from each bus include:

- **Voltage:** 1 to 118
- **Frequency:** 119 to 236
- **Phase Angle:** 237 to 354

This results in a total of 354 features per dataset. Labels (from 1 to 70) are included in column 355.
