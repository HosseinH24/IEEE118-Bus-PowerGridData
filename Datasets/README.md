# Datasets
There exist 6 datasets, compressed into separate `.zip` files, each of which contain a `.csv` file containing 354 features and one label column (the last column). Each dataset is constructed using a different combination of FR (Fault Resistance) and signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR). FR values are 1Ω and 10Ω, and SNR values are 50dB, 55dB, and 60dB.
